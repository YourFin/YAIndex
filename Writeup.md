While the section of this website that uses ruby on rails proper is fairly small, the requests pages very cleanly implement the core of what rails does provide, with the header and general body elements factored out into _wrapper.html.erb, and non-administrators are prevented from performing CRUD actions that they shouldn’t be able to. The elm section of the website demonstrates intimate knowledge of the rails 6 asset pipeline with webpacker, with some customization of the pipeline for this project’s use case. Rails deployment is automated with github actions and the heroku pipeline, with rails running behind an industry-standard reverse proxy to speed the loading of large files that may be in the project.
